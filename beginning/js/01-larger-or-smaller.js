// Usage: Use simple conditional statements
//Create an application that accepts two integers within two separate prompts. Then, display only the larger of the two within the browser window. Donâ€™t forget to handle the fact that the two could be equal.


let x = window.prompt("Enter a number between 1 and 10") + window.prompt("Enter a number between 1 and 10");
if (x == 5) 
    window.alert("It's bigger");
     else {
    window.alert("They are equal!");
}
